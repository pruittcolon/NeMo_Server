# Authentication Fix Status

## Current Situation (2025-10-26 07:00)

**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Files corrupted during automated fix

### Problem Discovered
During comprehensive testing, found that ALL API endpoints are unsecured:
- Unauthenticated requests return HTTP 200 with data
- Expected: HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- Root cause: `Cookie(None)` pattern inside function bodies doesn't work with FastAPI

### Fix Attempted
1. ✅ Removed all broken `Cookie(None)` patterns  
2. ✅ Added `session: Session = Depends(require_auth)` to functions
3. ❌ **AUTOMATED REGEX SCRIPTS CORRUPTED FILES**
4. ❌ Imports removed/mangled (lines 22-30 in rag/routes.py show code fragments instead of imports)

### Files Affected
- `src/services/rag/routes.py` - CORRUPTED
- `src/services/gemma/routes.py` - Needs verification
- `src/services/transcription/transcript_routes.py` - Needs verification  
- `src/services/speaker/routes.py` - Needs verification

### Next Steps (MANUAL FIX REQUIRED)
1. **Option A (Recommended):** Git reset to last known good state, then apply fix manually
2. **Option B:** Manually restore each file's import section

### Correct Pattern
```python
# At top of file
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query, Depends
from src.auth.permissions import require_auth
from src.auth.auth_manager import Session, UserRole

# In endpoint
@router.get("/endpoint")
def my_endpoint(
    param: str = Query(...),
    session: Session = Depends(require_auth)  # ✅ CORRECT
):
    # Now session is validated automatically
    if session.role == UserRole.ADMIN:
        # Admin logic
    else:
        # User logic with session.speaker_id
```

### Incorrect Patterns (DO NOT USE)
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Inside function body
def my_endpoint():
    from fastapi import Cookie
    ws_session = Cookie(None)  # This just returns None!
    session = require_auth(ws_session)
    
# ❌ WRONG - Inside Query()
def my_endpoint(
    param: str = Query(..., session: Session = Depends(require_auth))
):
    pass
```

### Test Command
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8000/memory/list
# Expected: 401
# Currently getting: 200
```

**Recommendation:** User should decide whether to:
1. Provide git access to reset files
2. Allow manual file-by-file restoration
3. Accept that this will take significant time to fix properly

**Est. Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (manual restoration + testing)
