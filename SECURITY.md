# Security Policy

## üîí Security Features

Nemo Server implements multiple layers of security:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based authentication** with HTTP-only cookies
- **Bcrypt password hashing** (industry standard, salted)
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, User roles)
- **100% speaker-based data isolation** at SQL level
- **Job ownership tracking** for AI analysis tasks

### Rate Limiting
- **100 requests per minute per IP address** (configurable)
- Protects against brute force attacks
- Prevents API abuse

### Data Protection
- **Speaker isolation**: Users can only access their own speaker's data
- **Admin override**: Administrators can view all data for system management
- **Session expiry**: Automatic logout after 24 hours (configurable)

### Network Security
- **IP whitelisting** for Flutter app transcription endpoint
- **CORS configuration** for web security
- **Security headers** (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### HTTP Only (No TLS/SSL)
**Current State**: The default configuration uses unencrypted HTTP.

**Risk**: Traffic between client and server is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to:
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Password interception
- Session hijacking on public networks

**Mitigation**: 
- Only use on trusted local networks
- Configure HTTPS with reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) for production
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates

### Default Passwords
**Risk**: The system ships with default credentials:
- `admin` / `admin123`
- `user1` / `user1pass`
- `television` / `tvpass123`

**Mitigation**: **CHANGE ALL DEFAULT PASSWORDS IMMEDIATELY** in `src/auth/auth_manager.py`

### Database Encryption
**Current State**: SQLite database is stored in plaintext.

**Risk**: Anyone with file system access can read the database.

**Mitigation**:
- Restrict file permissions on `instance/` directory
- Consider encrypted file system for sensitive deployments
- Implement database-level encryption if needed

### Local Network Only
**Current State**: Designed for local network deployment.

**Risk**: Not hardened for internet exposure.

**Mitigation**: 
- **DO NOT expose port 8000 directly to the internet**
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement additional firewall rules
- Consider adding API key authentication for production

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Deployment

### For Development/Testing
‚úÖ Use default configuration  
‚úÖ Local network only  
‚úÖ Default passwords acceptable  

### For Production
‚ùå Change ALL default passwords  
‚ùå Set `SECRET_KEY` and `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variables  
‚ùå Configure HTTPS (Let's Encrypt + Nginx)  
‚ùå Restrict `FLUTTER_WHITELIST` to specific IPs  
‚ùå Enable firewall rules  
‚ùå Regular security updates  
‚ùå Monitor access logs  
‚ùå Implement backup strategy  

### Recommended Production Setup

```bash
# 1. Set strong secrets
export SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# 2. Configure whitelist
export FLUTTER_WHITELIST="192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101"

# 3. Use HTTPS reverse proxy
# (See docs/HTTPS_SETUP.md for Nginx configuration)

# 4. Restrict Docker container
# Run as non-root user
# Limit resource usage
```

## üìù Security Audit Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` set to random value
- [ ] `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set to random value
- [ ] HTTPS configured and working
- [ ] `FLUTTER_WHITELIST` limited to specific IPs
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
